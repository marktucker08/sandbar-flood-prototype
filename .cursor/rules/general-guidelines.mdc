# General Coding Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all development.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability in all code.
- Ensure function and variable names are clear and descriptive.
- Use concise, meaningful comments for complex logic.
- The app directory should only contain:
    Page components (page.tsx files)
    Layout components (layout.tsx files)
    Loading states (loading.tsx)
    Error boundaries (error.tsx)
    Route handlers (route.ts files)

- All other components should live in the root components directory. This organization makes the codebase more maintainable and follows Next.js conventions for the App Router.
